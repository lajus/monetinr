Dumping the SQL database.
-------------------------

Start the SQL Server and SQL Client as usual.

In the SQL Client, type the following three commands.  Type them
at the start of the line::

	\>.../dump.sql
	\D
	\>

That is, first a line consisting of a backslash and greater than
symbol followed by the path name of the file in which you want to
store the dump.  This will redirect future output to the file
mentioned.  Then a line consisting of just backslash-capital D.  This
command does the actual dump which is, because of the previous line,
stored in the dump file.  And finally a line with a backslash and
greater than symbol.  This closes the file and redirects the output
back to the screen.

[Note: if you don't use the absolute path name of a file, the file
will be created in the directory where the SQL Client was started.  On
Windows this is at the location where the program was installed, and
therefore using an absolute path name is highly recommended.]

It is also possible to dump from the command line.  Start a SQL
Server, and then issue the command::

	msqldump -umonetdb > dump.sql

You will need to provide the password (monetdb).

This command will connect to the SQL Server and dump the database into
the file dump.sql in the current directory.

Restoring the SQL database.
---------------------------

After having dumped the database per the preceding instructions, it is
possible to restore the database using the following commands.

Start the SQL Server and SQL Client as usual.

In the SQL Client, type the following command::

	\<.../dump.sql

That is, a backslash and less than symbol followed by the path name of
the dump file that was produced using the dump instructions.  Again,
unless you use an absolute path name, the file name is relative to
where the SQL client was started, which on Windows may not be where
you expect.

It is also possible to restore from the command line.  Start a SQL
Server, and then issue the command::

	mclient -lsql -umonetdb -Pmonetdb < dump.sql
