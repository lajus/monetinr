In most cases we have to test Datacell using manual
interactions.

The key debugging operations are datacell.baskets()
and datacell.queries();
Furthermore some
The scenarios contain some hints to test the datacell.

A short checklist on functionality tests:
- test datacell.dump() on non-initialized datacell
- test if the actuator refus to contact non-started datacell
- test pause/resume of emitter using scenario00
- test pause/resume of query using scenarion00
- test pause/resume of receptor

- test emitter in UDP protocol (easiest)
- test emitter in TCP protocol, actuator start first!
