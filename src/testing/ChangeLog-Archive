- 
enabled "top-level" Mtest.py
So far, while Mtest.py could be called in any subdirectory of the MonetDB
source tree (and could then run all tests in the entire sub-tree),
it was not possible to call Mtest.py in the top-level MonetDB source
directory to run all tests.  Instead, to run all tests, Mtest.py had to
be called at least 4 times, once in each of these directories: "clients",
"monetdb5", "sql", "geom".
Now, it is possible to call Mtest.py once in the top-level MonetDB source
directory to run all tests in one go.
The behaviour of calling Mtest.py in any subdirectory, including the
four mentioned above, did not changed, other than that now obsolete
command line options "-p / --package <package>" and "-5 / --monetdb5"
have been removed.

* Mon May 31 2010 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 1.38.1-20100618
- Updated Vendor information.

* Tue Apr 20 2010 Stefan Manegold <manegold@cwi.nl> - 1.38.1-20100618
- Made compilation of "testing" (and "java") independent of MonetDB.
  This is mainly for Windows, but also on other systems, "testing" can
  now be built independently of (and hence before) "MonetDB".  Files
  that mimic configure functionality on Windows were moved from
  "MonetDB" to "buildtools"; hence, this affects all packages on
  Windows, requiring a complete rebuild from scratch on Windows.
  getopt() support in testing has changed; hence, (most probably)
  requiring a rebuild from scratch of testing on other systems.

* Tue Apr 20 2010 Stefan Manegold <manegold@cwi.nl> - 1.38.1-20100618
- Implemented build directory support for Windows, i.e., like on
  Unix/Linux also on Windows we can now build in a separate build
  directory as alternative to ...\<package>\NT, and thus keep the latter
  clean from files generated during the build.  On Windows, the build
  directory must be a sibling of ...\<package>\NT .
