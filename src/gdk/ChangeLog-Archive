* Mon Apr  8 2013 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.15.5-20130412
- Fixed a bug in case the candidate list is dense and completely
  outside the range of the bat being worked upon.

* Wed Aug  8 2012 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.13.1-20121010
- Removed the gdk_embedded (and embedded) option.  The code wasn't tested
  and most likely non-functional.

* Tue Jul 17 2012 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.13.1-20121010
- BAT-of-BATs is no longer allowed.  It was already not allowed to
  make these types of BATs persistent, but now they can't be created at
  all anymore.

* Fri Aug 31 2012 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.11.9-20120911
- Fixed a bug in BATantijoin when either side is a singleton BAT.
  This fixes bug 3139.

* Mon Jul  9 2012 Niels Nes <niels@cwi.nl> - 11.11.5-20120710
- Fixed intermittent problem that joins and selects return incorrect
  results and possibly inconsistent databases. The problems only occurred
  after a series of queries and updates, therefore it was hard to reproduce.

* Wed Apr  4 2012 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.11.1-20120706
- The sorted property, which was used to maintain whether a column in
  a BAT was sorted or reverse sorted, has been replaced by a pair of
  properties, sorted and revsorted.  These new properties can be set
  independently (unlike the old sorted property), and so if both are set,
  the column must be constant.  In addition, internal property checking
  has been overhauled.  Now, when a property is set incorrectly, and
  when assertions are enabled, an assertion will go off.  There is also
  a function which can derive properties.

* Thu Mar 15 2012 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.11.1-20120706
- Implemented proper overflow checking on all arithmetic operations.

* Thu May 17 2012 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.9.7-20120607
- Limit number of detected CPU cores to 16 on 32-bits systems to avoid
  running quickly out of addressable resources followed by a kill from
  the OS.

* Fri Apr 27 2012 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.9.3-20120514
- Implemented MT_getrss for Mac OS X systems, this allows the server to
  know about how much memory is currently in use.

* Tue Feb  7 2012 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.9.1-20120418
- The type "chr" has been removed.
  chr has long been superseded by bte for 1 byte arithmetic plus it is
  pretty useless to hold single characters since we use Unicode and
  thus only a tiny subset of the supported character set would fit.

* Tue Dec  6 2011 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.7.1-20120111
- Fixed memory detection on 32-bits Solaris systems with more memory
  than can be addressed in 32-bits mode, bug #2935

* Thu Aug 25 2011 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.5.1-20110907
- Removed conversion code for databases that still used the (more than
  two year) old format of "string heaps".

* Wed Aug 10 2011 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.5.1-20110907
- On Windows and Linux/Unix we can now read databases built on the other
  O/S, as long as the hardware-related architecture (bit size, floating
  point format, etc.) is identical.

* Wed May 11 2011 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.5.1-20110907
- Implemented automatic conversion of a 64-bit database with 32-bit OIDs
  to one with 64-bit OIDs.

* Sat Jul  9 2011 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.3.5-20110720
- Fixed a problem where appending string BATs could cause enormous growth
  of the string heap.  This fixes bug 2820.

* Wed Jun 29 2011 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.3.5-20110720
- Fixes to memory detection on FreeBSD.

* Fri May 13 2011 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.3.3-20110517
- Fixed a bug where large files (> 2GB) didn't always get deleted on
  Windows.

* Thu Apr 14 2011 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.3.1-20110414
- Fixed bugs in antiselect which gave the incorrect result when upper
  and lower bound were equal.  This bug could be triggered by the SQL
  query SELECT * FROM t WHERE x NOT BETWEEN y AND y.

* Tue Mar 22 2011 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.1.1-20110324
- Fixed memory detection on Darwin (Mac OS X) systems not to return
  bogus values

* Fri Jan 14 2011 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 11.1.1-20110317
- MonetDB/src/gdk was moved to gdk

* Fri Aug 20 2010 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 1.38.5-20100823
- Fixed a bug where some internal reference counting was done incorrectly,
  causing an infinite loop when exiting the server due to it being killed.
  This bug probably only manifested itself in MonetDB/XQuery.  Bug 2658.

* Mon May 31 2010 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 1.38.1-20100618
- Updated Vendor information.

* Fri May  7 2010 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl>
- Updated HowToStart.rst for our move from SourceForge for sources,
  trackers and downloads.

* Tue Apr 20 2010 Stefan Manegold <manegold@cwi.nl> - 1.38.1-20100618
- Made compilation of "testing" (and "java") independent of MonetDB.
  This is mainly for Windows, but also on other systems, "testing" can
  now be built independently of (and hence before) "MonetDB".  Files
  that mimic configure functionality on Windows were moved from
  "MonetDB" to "buildtools"; hence, this affects all packages on
  Windows, requiring a complete rebuild from scratch on Windows.
  getopt() support in testing has changed; hence, (most probably)
  requiring a rebuild from scratch of testing on other systems.

* Tue Apr 20 2010 Stefan Manegold <manegold@cwi.nl> - 1.38.1-20100618
- Implemented build directory support for Windows, i.e., like on
  Unix/Linux also on Windows we can now build in a separate build
  directory as alternative to ...\<package>\NT, and thus keep the latter
  clean from files generated during the build.  On Windows, the build
  directory must be a sibling of ...\<package>\NT .

* Thu Apr 15 2010 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 1.36.5-20100420
- Fixed a bug that could cause a crash when string BATs are combined.
  (SF bug 2947763.)

* Sun Apr 11 2010 Niels Nes <niels@cwi.nl> - 1.36.5-20100420
- Fixed a potential file leak: under certain conditions, files in the
  database might not get deleted when they should (they would be
  deleted when the server restarts).

* Mon Mar 29 2010 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 1.36.5-20100420
- Fix regression introduced in Feb2010-SP1 causing UDP connections to
  malfunction, in particular affecting the stethoscope tool.

* Mon Mar 01 2010 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 1.36.3-20100322
- Fixed bug in UDP stream creation causing UDP connections to already
  bound ports to be reported as successful.

* Mon Feb 22 2010 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 1.36.1-20100223
- Various concurrency bugs were fixed.
- Various changes were made to run better on systems that don't have
  enough memory to keep everything in core that was touched during
  query processing.  This is done by having the higher layers giving
  hints to the database kernel about future use, and the database
  kernel giving hints to the operating system kernel about how
  (virtual) memory is going to be used.

* Thu Feb 18 2010 Stefan Manegold <Stefan.Manegold@cwi.nl> - 1.36.1-20100223
- Fixed bug in mergejoin implementation.  This fixes bug #2952191.

* Tue Feb  2 2010 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 1.36.1-20100223
- Added support for compiling on Windows using the Cygwin-provided
  version of flex.

* Thu Jan 21 2010 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 1.36.1-20100223
- Fix compilation issue when configured with --with-curl.  This fixes
  bug #2924999.

* Thu Jan 21 2010 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl> - 1.36.1-20100223
- Added implementation of MT_getrss() for Solaris.  This yields in the
  kernel knowing about its (approximate) memory usage to try and help
  the operating system to free that memory that is best to free,
  instead of a random page, e.g. the work of the vmtrim thread.

* Wed Jan 20 2010 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@cwi.nl> - 1.36.1-20100223
- Implemented a "fast" string BAT append: Under certain conditions,
  instead of inserting values one-by-one, we now concatenate the
  string heap wholesale and just manipulate the offsets.  This works
  both for BATins and BATappend.

* Wed Jan  6 2010 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@cwi.nl> - 1.36.1-20100223
- Changed the string heap implementation to also contain the hashes of
  strings.
- Changed the implementation of the string offset columns to be
  dynamically sized.
