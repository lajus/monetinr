/*
 * @+ Memory management
 * Memory management in GDK mostly relies on the facilities offered by
 * the underlying OS.  The below routines monitor the available memory
 * resources which consist of physical swap space and logical vm
 * space.  There are three kinds of memory, that affect these two
 * resources in different ways:
 *
 * - memory mapping
 *   which ask for a logical region of virtual memory space.  In
 *   principle, no physical memory is needed to keep the system afloat
 *   here, as the memory mapped file is swapped onto a disk object
 *   that already exists.
 *
 *   Actually, there are two kings of memory mapping used in GDK,
 *   namely read-only direct mapped and writable copy-on write. For
 *   the dirty pages, the latter actually also consumes physical
 *   memory resources, but that is ignored here for simplicity.
 *
 * - anonymous virtual memory
 *   This is virtual memory that is mapped on the swap file. Hence,
 *   this consumes both logical VM space resources and physical memory
 *   space.
 *
 * - malloced memory
 *   comes from the heap and directly consumes physical memory
 *   resources.
 *
 * We check the resource consumption with preset target values, and if
 * these are exceeded, the routine BBPtrim is called that will unload
 * the least recently used BATs in order to decrease memory usage.
 *
 * The malloc routine checks the memory consumption every 1000 calls,
 * or for calls larger that 50000 bytes. Consequently, at least every
 * 50MB increase, alloc memory is checked. The VM calls always check
 * the memory consumption.
