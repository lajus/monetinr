 * @+ The sampling facilities
 *
 * In the context of the SciBORQ project, we introduce a number of sampling
 * techniques in the MonetDB software stack. Our goal is to provide methods
 * for performing sampling (uniform and weighted) over a) the result of a
 * query, b) the base tables, and c) the entire database schema. Sampling
 * can be performed during query execution, as well as during data loading in
 * the case of predefined sampling indexes. In addition to the sampling
 * methods, a number of query plan optimisations for sampling are introduced on
 * the SQL and MAL level.
 *
 * Besides the sampling methods, SciBORQ also aims at multi-layered bounded
 * query execution. That is steering query execution over many layers of
 * samples with different size in order to achieve either strict error bounds
 * or limited execution time. For more details see the SciBORQ module.
 *
 * In the following, details are presented on the implementation and the usage
 * of each sampling method.

/*
 * @- Uniform Sampling.
 *
 * A new SQL operator has been added to support sampling the result of a query.
 * The syntax for sampling is:
 * SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE ... SAMPLE s
 *
 * where s if is an integer greater than 1, it defines the number of rows to be
 * in the sample. If s is a double between [0.0,1.0] the it refers to the
 * percentage of the result to be sampled. That is if s=0.3 then the sample
 * will be 30% the size of the query result.
 *
 * SAMPLE is been treated as LIMIT, ORDER BY, etc., that means that it can only
 * be in the outer most SELECT clause, i.e., SAMPLE cannot appear in a
 * subquery. However, if this is needed, then one may define a function, for
 * example 
 *
 * CREATE FUNCTION mysample ()
 * RETURNS TABLE(col a,...)
 * BEGIN
 *    RETURN
 *      SELECT a,...
 *      FROM name_table
 *      SAMPLE 100;
 * end;
 *
 * and then use function mysample() for example to populate a new table with
 * the sample. E.g.,
 *
 * INSERT INTO sample_table (SELECT * FROM mysample());
