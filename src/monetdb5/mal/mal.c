 * @+ Design Considerations
 * Redesign of the MonetDB software stack was driven by the need to
 * reduce the effort to extend the system into novel directions
 * and to reduce the Total Execution Cost (TEC).
 * The TEC is what an end-user or application program will notice.
 * The TEC is composed on several cost factors:
 * @itemize
 * @item  A)
 * API message handling
 * @item  P)
 * Parsing and semantic analysis
 * @item  O)
 * Optimization and plan generation
 * @item  D)
 * Data access to the persistent store
 * @item  E)
 * Execution of the query terms
 * @item R)
 * Result delivery to the application
 * @end itemize
 *
 * Choosing an architecture for processing database operations pre-supposes an
 * intuition on how the cost will be distributed. In an OLTP
 * setting you expect most of the cost to be in (P,O), while in OLAP it will
 * be (D,E,R). In a distributed setting the components (O,D,E) are dominant.
 * Web-applications would focus on (A,E,R).
 *
 * Such a simple characterization ignores the wide-spread
 * differences that can be experienced at each level. To illustrate,
 * in D) and R) it makes a big difference whether the data is already in the
 * cache or still on disk. With E) it makes a big difference whether you
 * are comparing two integers, evaluation of a mathematical function,
 * e.g., Gaussian, or a regular expression evaluation on a string.
 * As a result, intense optimization in one area may become completely invisible
 * due to being overshadowed by other cost factors.
 *
 * The Version 5 infrastructure is designed to ease addressing each
 * of these cost factors in a well-defined way, while retaining the
 * flexibility to combine the components needed for a particular situation.
 * It results in an architecture where you assemble the components
 * for a particular application domain and hardware platform.
 *
 * The primary interface to the database kernel is still based on
 * the exchange of text in the form of queries and simply formatted results.
 * This interface is designed for ease of interpretation, versatility and
 * is flexible to accommodate system debugging and application tool development.
 * Although a textual interface potentially leads to a performance degradation,
 * our experience with earlier system versions
 * showed that the overhead can be kept within acceptable bounds.
 * Moreover, a textual interface reduces the programming
 * effort otherwise needed to develop test and application programs.
 * The XML trend as the language for tool interaction supports our decision.
 * @-
 * @node Architecture Overview, MAL Synopsis, Design Considerations, Design  Overview
 * @+ Architecture Overview
 * The architecture is built around a few independent components:
 * the MonetDB server, the merovigian, and the client application.
 * The MonetDB server is the heart of the system, it manages a single
 * physical database on one machine for all (concurrent) applications.
 * The merovigian program works along side a single server, keeping
 * an eye on its behavior. If the server accidently crashes, it is this program
 * that will attempt an automatic restart.
 *
 * The top layer consists of applications written in your favorite
 * language.
 * They provide both specific functionality
 * for a particular product, e.g., @url{http://kdl.cs.umass.edu/software,Proximity},
 * and generic functionality, e.g.,
 * the @url{http://www.aquafold.com,Aquabrowser} or @url{http://www.minq.se,Dbvisualizer}.
 * The applications communicate with the server
 * using de-facto standard interface packaged,
 * i.e., JDBC, ODBC, Perl, PHP, etc.
 *
 * The middle layer consists of query language processors such as
 * SQL and XQuery. The former supports the core functionality
 * of SQL'99 and extends into SQL'03. The latter is based on
 * the W3C standard and includes the XUpdate functionality.
 * The query language processors each manage their own private catalog structure.
 * Software bridges, e.g., import/export routines, are used to
 * share data between language paradigms.

 * @node MAL Synopsis, Execution Engine, Architecture Overview,  Design  Overview
 * @+ MonetDB Assembly Language (MAL)
 * The target language for a query compiler is
 * the MonetDB Assembly Language (MAL).
 * It was designed to ease code generation
 * and fast interpretation by the server.
 * The compiler produces algebraic query plans, which
 * are turned into  physical execution
 * plans by the MAL optimizers.
 *
 * The output of a compiler is either an @sc{ascii} representation
 * of the MAL program or the compiler is tightly coupled with
 * the server to save parsing and communication overhead.
 *
 * A snippet of the MAL code produced by the SQL compiler
 * for the query @sc{select count(*) from tables}
 * is shown below. It illustrates a sequences of relational
 * operations against a table column and producing a
 * partial result.
 * @example
 * 	...
 *     _22:bat[:oid,:oid]  := sql.bind_dbat("tmp","_tables",0);
 *     _23 := bat.reverse(_22);
 *     _24 := algebra.kdifference(_20,_23);
 *     _25 := algebra.markT(_24,0:oid);
 *     _26 := bat.reverse(_25);
 *     _27 := algebra.join(_26,_20);
 *     _28 := bat.setWriteMode(_19);
 *     bat.append(_28,_27,true);
 * 	...
 * @end example
 *
 * MAL supports the full breadth of computational paradigms
 * deployed in a database setting. It is language framework
 * where the execution semantics is determined by the
 * code transformations and the final engine choosen.
 *
 * The design and implementation of MAL takes the functionality offered
 * previously a significant step further. To name a few:
 * @itemize @bullet
 * @item All instructions are strongly typed before being executed.
 * @item It supports polymorphic functions.
 * They act as templates that produce strongly typed instantiations when needed.
 * @item Function style expressions where
 * each assignment instruction can receive multiple target results;
 * it forms a point in the dataflow graph.
 * @item It supports co-routines (Factories) to build streaming applications.
 * @item Properties are associated with the program code for
 * ease of optimization and scheduling.
 * @item It can be readily extended with user defined types and
 * function modules.
 * @end itemize
 *
 * @-
 * @+ Critical sections and semaphores
 * MonetDB Version 5 is implemented as a collection of threads.
 * This calls for extreme
 * care in coding. At several places locks and semaphores are necessary
 * to achieve predictable results. In particular, after they are created
 * and when they are inspected or being modified to take decisions.
 *
 * In the current implementation the following list of locks and semaphores
 * is used in the Monet layer:
 *
