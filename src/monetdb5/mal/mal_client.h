 * The prompt structure is designed to simplify recognition of the
 * language framework for interaction. For direct console access it is a
 * short printable ascii string. For access through an API we assume the
 * prompt is an ascii string surrounded by a \001 character. This
 * simplifies recognition.  The information between the prompt brackets
 * can be used to pass the mode to the front-end. Moreover, the prompt
 * can be dropped if a single stream of information is expected from the
 * server (see mal_profiler.mx).
 *
 * The user can request server-side compilation as part of the
 * initialization string. See the documentation on Scenarios.
