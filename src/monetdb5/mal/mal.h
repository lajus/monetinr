 * @node Execution Engine, Session Scenarios, MAL Synopsis , Design  Overview
 * @+ Execution Engine
 * The execution engine comes in several flavors. The default is a
 * simple, sequential MAL interpreter. For each MAL function call it creates
 * a stack frame, which is initialized with all constants found in the
 * function body. During interpretation the garbage collector
 * ensures freeing of space consumptive tables (BATs) and strings.
 * Furthermore, all temporary structures are garbage collected before
 * the funtion returns the result.
 *
 * This simple approach leads to an accumulation of temporary variables.
 * They can be freed earlier in the process using an explicit garbage collection
 * command, but the general intend is to leave such decisions to an optimizer
 * or scheduler.
 *
 * The execution engine is only called when all MAL instructions
 * can be resolved against the available libraries.
 * Most modules are loaded when the server starts using a
 * bootstrap script @sc{mal_init.mx}
 * Failure to find the startup-file terminates the session.
 * It most likely points to an error in the MonetDB configuration file.
 *
 * During the boot phase, the global symbol table is initialized
 * with MAL function and factory definitions, and
 * loading the pre-compiled commands and patterns.
 * The libraries are dynamically loaded by default.
 * Expect tens of modules and hundreds of operations to become readily available.
 *
 * Modules can not be dropped without restarting the server.
 * The rational behind this design decision is that a dynamic load/drop feature
 * is often hardly used and severely complicates the code base.
 * In particular, upon each access to the global symbol table we have to be
 * prepared that concurrent threads may be actively changing its structure.
 * Especially, dropping modules may cause severe problems by not being
 * able to detect all references kept around.
 * This danger required all accesses to global information to be packaged
 * in a critical section, which is known to be a severe performance hindrance.
