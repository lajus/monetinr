 * particular SQL needs it to dump (and later restore) users.
 * The database administrator can unlock the BAT that stores the password
 * (the vault) by supplying the master password which is the key for the
 * cypher algorithm used to store the data.  The BAT will never
 * contain the plain hashes, as they will be decyphered on the fly when
 * needed.  A locked vault means noone can log into the system, hence, the
 * vault needs to be unlocked as part of the server startup ritual.
