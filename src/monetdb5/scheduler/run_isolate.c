 * @+ Run isolation
 * Run isolation involves making available a private copy of the MAL
 * block being executed for further massaging, e.g. code replacements
 * or flow-of-control adjustments.
 * These changes should be confined to a single execution. The next time around
 * there may be a different situation to take care off. This is achieved by
 * replacing the current program with a private copy.
 *
 * The easiest way is to duplicate the MAL program and assign the old
 * version to its history. This way any reference to individual instructions
 * remain valid and the result of the schedule action can be inspected
 * with the debugger.
 * Its lifetime then is identical to that of the main program call.
 *
 * The first example create a private copy, leaving out the scheduler call.
 * @example
 * @code{
 * function f();
 *     i@{runonce, rows>4@}:=1;	# just properties
 *     mdb.list();
 *     io.print("start running\n");
 *     scheduler.isolation();
 *     io.print("done\n");
 *     mdb.list();
 * end f;
 * f(); #shows self-modification in action
 * }
 * @end example
 * This function with its history remain available as long as f()
 * is defined.
