* Mon Jul  2 2012 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.11.1-20120706
- Created seperate RPM and DEB packages for MonetDB/JAQL.

* Tue Jun  5 2012 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.11.1-20120706
- Removed --enable-bits option from configure.

* Thu Apr 19 2012 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.11.1-20120706
- Split the MonetDB-client-ruby RPM package into two and named them in
  accordance with the Fedora packaging guidelines as rubygem-<gem-name>.

* Wed May  2 2012 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.9.3-20120514
- Windows: we now use OpenSSL 1.0.1b.

* Wed Feb 22 2012 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.7.7-20120224
- Fixed some of the package names for Debian/Ubuntu.  Packages for
  libraries should contain the major number of the library version number.
  This was not always the case.

* Tue Feb  7 2012 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.7.7-20120224
- On Debian and Ubuntu, install Python modules in dist-packages instead
  of site-packages.  This fixed bug 2997.

* Sat Aug  6 2011 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.5.1-20110907
- Fixed Fedora 15 (and presumably later) configuration that uses a tmpfs
  file system for /var/run.  This fixes bug 2850.

* Wed Jul 20 2011 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.5.1-20110907
- The default OID size for 64-bit Windows is now 64 bits.  Databases with
  32 bit OIDs are converted automatically.

* Wed Jul 13 2011 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.3.5-20110720
- We can now build RPMs on CentOS 6.0.  Since there is no geos library
  on CentOS, we do not support the geom modules there.

* Wed Jun 29 2011 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 11.3.5-20110720
- We can now also build on Fedora 15.  This required some very minor
  changes.
- Changed configure check for OpenSSL so that we can also build on CentOS
  5.6.  We now no longer demand that OpenSSL is at least version 0.9.8f,
  but instead we require that the hash functions we need are supported.

* Thu Nov  2 2010 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org>
- On Windows, we now no longer use the pthreads library but instead
  use the "native" threads, semaphores, and mutex implementation.

* Wed Sep 22 2010 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl>
- We now provide pkg-config files (*.pc) for libraries.

* Thu Jul 22 2010 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org> - 1.0-20100823
- Changed Maddlog to search up the directory tree to find a ChangeLog
  file.

* Fri May  7 2010 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl>
- Fixed Maddlog script to work under our new Mercurial setup.  The
  --email and --fullname options have disappeared as we can relibably
  get them from Mercurial now.

* Wed Mar 31 2010 Stefan Manegold <manegold@cwi.nl> - 1.0-20100823
- Made compilation of "testing" (and "java") independent of MonetDB.
  This is mainly for Windows, but also on other systems, "testing" can
  now be built independently of (and hence before) "MonetDB".  Files
  that mimic configure functionality on Windows were moved from
  "MonetDB" to "buildtools"; hence, this affects all packages on
  Windows, requiring a complete rebuild from scratch on Windows.
  getopt() support in testing has changed; hence, (most probably)
  requiring a rebuild from scratch of testing on other systems.

* Wed Mar 24 2010 Stefan Manegold <manegold@cwi.nl> - 1.0-20100823
- Implemented build directory support for Windows, i.e., like on
  Unix/Linux also on Windows we can now build in a separate build
  directory as alternative to ...\<package>\NT, and thus keep the latter
  clean from files generated during the build.  On Windows, the build
  directory must be a sibling of ...\<package>\NT .

* Fri Jan  8 2010 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@cwi.nl>
- Added Maddlog script to add ChangeLog entries.

* Tue Dec  1 2009 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl>
- Added mchangelog script that I use to add ChangeLog entries. The
  script is a highly modified version of Gentoo's echangelog script.

* Thu Dec  6 2007 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl>
- Implemented rudimentary conditional support for ant targets

* Wed Dec  5 2007 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl>
- Allow for 'included' dependencies, such that the wonders of libtool
  can compile against a build dir of a dependency, instead of its
  installation dir.

* Tue Jan  9 2007 Fabian Groffen <fabian@cwi.nl>
- Initial autotooled setup
